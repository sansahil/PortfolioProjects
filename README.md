# COVID Portfolio Project - Data Exploration

## Project Overview
This project focuses on exploring COVID-19 data using SQL to gain insights into the global pandemic. The goal is to analyze trends, identify key patterns, and draw meaningful conclusions from the data. The project utilizes SQL queries for data exploration, analysis, and visualization.

## Folder Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw or processed datasets used for analysis.
- `sql/`: Holds the SQL scripts used to explore the data.
- `notebooks/`: (Optional) Jupyter notebooks used for additional analysis or visualization.
- `reports/`: (Optional) Contains final reports or visualizations created from the data exploration.

## Data Source
The data used in this project can be found in the `data/` folder. It can be sourced from:
- [Our World in Data - COVID-19 Dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-dataset)
- [Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 Dataset](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

## SQL Scripts
The main SQL script for exploring the COVID-19 data is located in the `sql/` folder:
- **`Data_Exploration.sql`**: This script includes various SQL queries used to explore COVID-19 cases, deaths, and trends.

### Key SQL Queries:
- Summary statistics of total cases and deaths.
- Top 10 countries with the most cases.
- Daily growth rate of new COVID-19 cases.
- Countries with the highest death rates.
- Cases per million population.

## Requirements
To run the SQL scripts, you need a database environment such as:
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- SQLite

### Steps to Run the SQL Queries:
1. Download the dataset (if not included) and import it into your preferred SQL database.
2. Open the `Data_Exploration.sql` script.
3. Run the queries in your SQL editor.

## Additional Analysis
You can perform additional analysis using Python, R, or Jupyter notebooks for further data visualization and machine learning models. Check the `notebooks/` folder for examples.
